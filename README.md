Simulation-based Trust Management Model for VANETs using SUMO and Python
# Trust Management Model for VANET Simulation

This project implements a trust-based evaluation model for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) using traffic simulation.

## Overview
- Simulates an urban traffic environment using SUMO
- Evaluates vehicle trust based on observed behavior
- Identifies unreliable or malicious vehicles
- Logs trust scores for analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
- XML (Network & Route Configuration)
- VANET Concepts

## How to Run
1. Install SUMO
2. Configure the simulation using `delhi.sumocfg`
3. Run the Python trust evaluation script

## Note on Simulation Files
Due to GitHub file size limits, large network and route files are not included.
They can be generated using SUMO tools or provided upon request.

4. Analyze the generated trust logs

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of VANETs
- Experience with traffic simulation
- Trust evaluation and log analysis
